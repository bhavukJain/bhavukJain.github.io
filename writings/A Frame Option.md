Fingers running through golden streaks,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaze fixed on the screen, wondering.
Elbows grazing, side by side,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Minds out for a stroll, wandering.
Legs peeking out her white summer dress,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes seeking out a place to hide, unassuming.
Lips dare not get any closer again,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts cruising down the highway, only whispering. 

Tossing, turning, awake in the dark.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel the beat of a heart jolted 
&nbsp;&nbsp;By a spark.
See her standing in the California sun,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear her paint the heart she has won.
