My name is Bhavuk Jain. I am working as a Software Developer at Expedia Inc. I graduated with Bachelors in Information Technology in May,2016 from NSIT, University of Delhi. Since graduation, I have been working as an Software Developer at Expedia Inc. I am primarily involved in developing a platform that can enable migration of diverse Expedia's internal microservices to Cloud. 

My interests lie in the areas of Machine Learning and Cloud Computing and I enjoy the cross between the Computer Algorithms, problem solving, and Mathematics. Having some experience in this area has peaked my interest and driven me to explore as much as I can in my own time.
